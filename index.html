                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>My name is Obakeng, and most people who know me call me Obakeng while some call me by my middle
                    name
                    Kennedy.
                    I was born in South Africa in a small town known as Mahikeng. I am currently enrolled for a
                    online
                    degree in Software Development
                    with BYU-Idaho. I am currently single and looking to get married and start a family. I enjoy
                    learning
                    new things about how the technology
                    that we use each day works.

                <h2>Mahikeng, South Africa</h2>
                <img src="images/sa_flag.png" alt="Flag of South Africa" />
                <p>Mahikeng is situated in the North West Province of South Africa and is a border town located
                    near
                    South Africa's border with Botswana to the North.
                    The town is also the seat of the North West Provincial Government and the North West
                    Division of
                    the High Court of South Africa. Mahikeng is also home
                    to one of the 3 campuses of the North West University, which is one of the leading
                    universities
                    in South Africa.
