        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Obakeng, and most people who know me call me Obakeng while some call me by my middle name Kennedy.
        I was born in South Africa in a small town known as Mahikeng. I am currently enrolled for a online degree in Software Development
        with BYU-Idaho. I am currently single and looking to get married and start a family. I enjoy learning new things about how the technology
        that we use each day works.
